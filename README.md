# Credit Card Fraud Detection (Anomaly Detection)

A machine learning project using Isolation Forest to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from an imbalanced dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Features: PCA components, Amount, Time, and Class

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn)
- Isolation Forest (unsupervised anomaly detection)
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## 📊 Key Results
- Accuracy: ~99.6% (due to class imbalance)
- Focused on improving recall/precision on fraud detection

## 📈 Visualizations
- Class Imbalance
- Amount by Fraud/Non-Fraud
- Anomaly Detection Output

## 🚀 Future Work
- Try other algorithms (LOF, AutoEncoders)
- Apply SMOTE or Under-sampling
- Build Streamlit UI
